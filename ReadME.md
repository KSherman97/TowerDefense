## Description
Hello, thank you for expressing interest in my game. It would be greatly appreciated if you would E-Mail bugs or things to add, to me. This can be accomplished by E-Mailing ksherm337@gmail.com. Know that this work is not copyrighted in any way, however it has taking months to code it and make the art. It is because of this that I ask, please do not distribute this game as your own work. Be courteous and just enjoy. With your help “we” can make this the best game possible, remember E-Mail, E-Mail, E-Mail!!! It only takes a second and can be very helpful.
This game is able to be customized with mods. Such as:
-	Custom Graphics
-	Custom Maps
-	In the near future I will release the code for better customization

Thanks again for playing,

Sincerely,
Kyle S.
